# The Berry-Sethi Algorithm for Regular Expressions

These slides introduce the audience to Regular Expressions, Formal Grammars and
Languages, the Chomsky-Hierarchy, Non-Deterministic and Deterministic Finite
Automata, and eventually the Berry-Sethi Algorithm.
<p>

Over the course of the slides, the reader is gradually introduced to parsing a
regular expression with a recursive descent parser, implementing Berry-Sethi's
concept of the set of first, next and last nodes, and eventually deriving an NFA
which will accept the same language as defined by the regular expression.

Please note that the slides are in German. For the presentation I have used
[patat](https://github.com/jaspervdj/patat) (best rendered in a terminal of
approximately 106x28 characters). The talk was held at the
[TNG](https://www.tngtech.com) Techday on December 4th, 2020.
